# Introduction

*The summary output shows the Min, 1st Qu, Median, Mean, 3rd Qu, and Max for Air.Flow, Water.Temp, Acid.Conc, Stack.loss

*The str output shows the stackflow dataframe has 21 observations of 4 variables

```{r stackloss}
summary(stackloss)
str(stackloss)
```

# Including Plots

*There is a positive correlation between Air.Flow and stack.loss as when the airflow increases the stackloss increases as well.

```{r scatterplot, echo=FALSE}
plot(stack.loss ~ Air.Flow, data = stackloss, xlab = "Air Flow", ylab = "Stack Loss", main = "Scatterplot of stack.loss vs. Air.Flow")
```
